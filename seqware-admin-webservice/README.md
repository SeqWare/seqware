SeqWare-Sandbox
===============

A location where we can explore new SeqWare sub-projects, tools, and prototypes
before they are ready for the main repo.

Please use HubFlow with feature branches when you prototype.  Make sure you use
a distinct directory for each prototype with your own pom.xml file at the root.
We will not use a common pom.xml inn the root of the repo, each prototype will
be built independently.
