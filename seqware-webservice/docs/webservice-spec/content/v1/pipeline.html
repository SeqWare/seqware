title: Pipeline Resources

These jobs loosely correspond with tasks performed by SeqWare Pipeline, for example, launching workflows, modules, and plugins. Pipeline tasks are distinguished from Metadata tasks because they trigger more advanced processing of the data by systems other than those associated with the Metadata DB. For example, jobs triggered on the pipeline may cause a job to be run on a server, or a ZIP file to be uploaded and installed as a workflow.

At the moment, a workflow can be launched through a [job](/v1/pipeline/job/) resource.
