  ** src/net/sourceforge/seqware/queryengine/webservice/view/ConsequenceResource.java:        settings.setReadOnly(true);
  ** src/net/sourceforge/seqware/queryengine/webservice/view/MismatchResource.java:        settings.setReadOnly(true);
  ** src/net/sourceforge/seqware/queryengine/webservice/view/CoverageResource.java:        settings.setReadOnly(true);
