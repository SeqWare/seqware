In relation to Hubflow, our procedure will be as follows. For new features that 
are still in a feature branch, documentation can be kept in that feature branch. 
Compilation should be invoked for local viewing, but do not push the results to 
the public website. New documentation meant for public release should be done on 
the 'develop' branch. 'Master' should be avoided and should only be modified 
during releases or with the Hubflow hotfix workflow.

Install nanoc (on Ubuntu 12.04):

For a basic version of nanoc just follow the directions on their site. This is
what I had to do to get their very nice sample website to compile:

sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1 ruby-rvm ruby-rdiscount ruby-nokogiri


sudo gem install nanoc kramdown adsf mime-types compass haml coderay rubypants builder rainpress


Hack on Linux Mint 13:

I had problems compiling the site until I commented out the following on line 23 of /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/sass-3.2.3/lib/sass/importers/filesystem.rb

      # @see Base#find_relative
      def find_relative(name, base, options)
        #_find(File.dirname(base), name, options)
      end

Be careful with this, I have no idea if I broke anything by doing this.

Also, I originally installed this but I had to disable this in the code, didn't seem to work for me

sudo gem install fast-aleck 

Source code is here:
seqware/seqware-distribution/docs/site

In order to add/use variables:
look at site/content/docs/webservice-api/seqware-webservice/metadata/db/study_get.html which uses site/lib/helpers_.rb

In order to do an include:
look at the admin guide for an example at site/content/docs/3-getting-started/admin-tutorial.md which uses site/layouts/includes/

Go into this directory and compile the site:
nanoc compile

View the site in http://localhost:3000 :
nanoc view

Dynamically compile and view the site at localhost:3000:
nanoc autocompile

To run checks for broken links:
nanoc check external_links
nanoc check ilinks (check internal links)
nanoc check --deploy (all checks)

Modify the index.html so the logo points to /seqware/ and the css points to /seqware/style.css

Push to github (gh-pages):
mvn site-deploy

In order to publish to seqware.github.com, checkout our current hotfix and publish our site:

    git checkout hotfix/0.13.6.7
    cd seqware-distribution 
    mvn site-deploy

Then you would look at the site at: http://seqware.github.io

In order to publish to our unstable docs supporting the development of 1.0.0, checkout from develop and publish:

    git checkout develop 
    cd seqware-distribution 
    mvn site-deploy

Then you would look at the site at: http://seqware.github.io/unstable.seqware.github.com/
