Install nanoc:

For a basic version of nanoc just follow the directions on their site. This is
what I had to do to get their very nice sample website to compile:

sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1
sudo apt-get install ruby-rvm
sudo apt-get install ruby-rdiscount
sudo apt-get install ruby-nokogiri

sudo gem install nanoc
sudo gem install kramdown
sudo gem install adsf
sudo gem install mime-types
sudo gem install fast-aleck # had to disable this in the code, didn't seem to work for me
sudo gem install compass
sudo gem install compass
sudo gem install haml
sudo gem install coderay
sudo gem install rubypants
sudo gem install builder
sudo gem install rainpress

Source code is here:
seqware/seqware-distribution/docs/site

Prototype code is here:
seqware/seqware-distribution/docs/site-prototype

Compile the site:
nanoc compile

View the site in http://localhost:3000 :
nanoc view

Dynamically compile and view the site at localhost:3000:
nanoc autocompile

Get the website pages:
git clone -b gh-pages git@github.com:SeqWare/seqware.git gh-page

Update the branch with the new pages:
cp -R seqware/seqware-distribution/docs/site/output/* gh-pages/

Modify the index.html so the logo points to /seqware/ and the css points to /seqware/style.css

Push to github (both on the source and gh-pages):
git pull
git add *
git commit -m "Changed things"
git push
