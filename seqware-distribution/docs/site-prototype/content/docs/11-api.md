## Overview

This guide will collect the documentation for our various APIs including Javadoc and RESTful web interfaces. 

## SeqWare Web Service
These docs are generated by another nanoc template (just to make it complicated) but will be merged into the main site soon.
The [API](http://seqware.github.com/webservice-api/) covers the SeqWare Web Service sub-project and is the main RESTful entry point for the project.

## Javadoc 

The Javadoc for the release of version 0.12.5 can be found [here](/javadoc/svn_0.12.5/)

The Javadoc for the simplified workflow can be found [here](/javadoc/simplifiedworkflow/)
