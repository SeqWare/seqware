SeqWare site
============

This is the source for the SeqWare site. It is based on the nanoc tool and
their example site (<http://nanoc.stoneship.org>).  Over time we will continue
to learn from their example and diverage our look and feel to respect the
distinct look and feel of the nanoc site.

All content not previously covered under the nanoc copyright is copyright
2007-2012 by Brian O'Connor and may not be copied without the express
permission from Denis Defreyne.

The SeqWare project is released under the GNU GPL v3.

From the original ReadMe:
------------------------

This site is provided as an example to show off how nanoc can be used, and that
there is no need to keep your site source secret; none of it runs on the server
anyway.

Also check out the Stoneship site source, available in the Mercurial
repository at <http://nanoc.stoneship.org/hg/sites-stoneship>.
