## Overview 

The reporting tools for [studies](/docs/21-study-reporter/), [sequencer
runs](/docs/20-sequencer-run-reporter/), and [workflow
runs](/docs/19-workflow-run-reporter/) each generate tab-delimited reports that
also include file output URLs.  We currently do not have a bulk export tool in
SeqWare but the ProvisionFiles module can be used to copy remote files from
these reports to a local system.

For more information on using ProvisionFiles see the module descriptions [page](/docs/17a-modules/#provisionfiles).
