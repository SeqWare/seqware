Is SeqWare right for me?
: Take a look at the [Introduction](/docs/1-introduction/) which describes why you would want to use SeqWare and why you would not.

Is there a web-based GUI for writing workflows?  For launching workflows?
: Yes, the SeqWare Portal provides a GUI for launching workflows.  Building workflows, however, is a programmatic process.

Do I need to be a programmer to use SeqWare?  Do I need to be a bioinformatician?
: There are three primary types of SeqWare users, see the main [Documentation](/docs/) page for a description for each. For users of workflows, you do not need to be a developer, however to be an effective workflow developer you should be comfortable with bioinformatics tools and have at least very basic Java programming skills.

Can I contribute to the project?
: Of course! See our [Community](/community/) page.

How do I report problems?
: We use a public bug tracker for user requests and bug reports. See our [Community](/community/) page.

How can I get support for using SeqWare?
: We have a mailing list, see our [Community](/community/) page.

Is there a commercially supported version of SeqWare?
: [Nimbus Informatics](http://nimbusinformatics.com) provides a workflow creation service and hosts SeqWare on the Amazon cloud. 

Is there a VM available?
: Yes, a local VM can be downloaded and/or a cloud VM (AMI) can be used on Amazon's cloud, see the [Installation](/docs/2-installation/) guide.

What is the fastest way to setup SeqWare in my organization?
: We recommend using our VM (or AMI on the cloud). For a local VM you can actually connect it to your cluster infrastructure directly.

What workflow language should I use?
: Our Java workflow language is the current recommended choice.

What workflow engine should I use?
: Our Pegasus workflow engine is the current recommended choice.
