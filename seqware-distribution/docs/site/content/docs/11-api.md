## Overview

This guide will collect the documentation for our various APIs including Javadoc and RESTful web interfaces. 

<!-- This looks to have disappeared, investigate 

## SeqWare MetaDB Schema

These docs are generated by the [SchemaSpy](http://sourceforge.net/projects/schemaspy/) tool and show our PostgreSQL database schema.

## SeqWare Web Service
These docs are generated by another nanoc template (just to make it complicated) but will be merged into the main site soon.
The [API](/docs/7-web-service/#web-service-api) covers the SeqWare Web Service sub-project and is the main RESTful entry point for the project.

## SeqWare Query Engine
These docs were generated by Swagger.  The [API](http://seqware-qe.elasticbeanstalk.com/ui/) is not currently hooked up to a Hadoop back-end, so queries will not return any valid data. However, this gives an idea as to the general shape of the API.
