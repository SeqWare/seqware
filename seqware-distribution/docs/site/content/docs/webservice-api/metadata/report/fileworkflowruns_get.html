Parameters
--------------
files
: 
SWIDs (SeqWare accessions) for the files that we wish to base the search on, comma-delimited if more than one file is needed to be considered
search

search
: one of "CHILDREN_VIA_PROCESSING_RELATIONSHIP", "CHILDREN_VIA_IUS_WORKFLOW_RUN", "CHILDREN_VIA_LANE_WORKFLOW_RUN." In the first search pattern, workflow_runs found by joining the File, Processing, processing_relationship, and Workflow_Run tables are reported. In the second search pattern, children found by looking at potentially related children found by looking through workflow_runs that share an IUS but have not been successfully linked to the processing hierarchy are returned. In the third pattern, children found by looking at the equivalent, except sharing a Lane instead of an IUS are returned.
