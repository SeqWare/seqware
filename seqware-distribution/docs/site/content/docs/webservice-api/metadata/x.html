Overview
----------

These resources are for those under development or in a testing phase. They can be turned off at runtime to prohibit risky operations. 

## Validation Report API

A collection of reports useful when verifying that data in the SeqWare meta
db is correct.

### File reverse hierarchy display

    GET /x/report/reversehierarchy/{file-swa}

Produces a text representation of a reverse hierarchy tree starting at a
file (indicated by the provided file-swa). The tree includes all the
processing nodes that led to the creation of the file as well as all the
links (sequencer_run, lane, ius, sample, experiment, study) to those
processing nodes.
 
This report is useful for answering the question: What steps led to the
creation of this file?

### File link report

    GET /x/report/filelinkreport/{file-swa}

Every file must be associated with at least one processing node and this
node in turn must be linked (either directly or through a parent) to one of
 the following: sequencer_run, lane, ius, sample, experiment or study.
 
This report includes all files included in the given list of file-swas (file
SeqWare accesssions) and notes the number of links that exist for that
file. An orphaned files is inidicated when the total number of links for the
file is zero (0). Most files will have 1 or 2 links. Files with more than
2 links are not necessarily incorrectly linked, but are worthy of investigation to
ensure they are correctness.

#### Input

You can provide a list of file-swas to report on.

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript">
182467,186014,25877
</code></pre>

If no file-swa is provided the report will be generated for all the files in the seqware meta db. A report that includes all the files will take a long time to produce.
