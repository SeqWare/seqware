title: Metadata Resources 
---

Operations on the metadata resources are primarily for read-only access of the SeqWare metadata database. Any PUT or POST operations add only one row to one table in the SeqWare Metadata database. There are four classifications of resources:

* [Data](/seqware-webservice/metadata/db/) - Resources that adds, retrieves or updates one or more rows from a database table.
* [Reports](/seqware-webservice/metadata/report/) - Resources that query the state of the Metadata DB and amalgamate information from multiple database tables in order to report on the state of a study, sequencer run, sample, etc. 
* [Jobs](/seqware-webservice/metadata/job/) - Resources that cause considerable processing on the server side and include PUT and POST operations.
* [Experimental](/seqware-webservice/metadata/x/) - Resources that are in development or in a testing phase.
