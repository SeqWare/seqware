<h1>Next-Generation Sequencing Analysis on the Grid and in the Cloud</h1>

<p>The open source SeqWare project is a portable software infrastructure designed to analyze massive genomics datasets produced by contemporary and emerging technologies, in particular Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platforms.  It consists of a comprehensive suite of tools focused on enabling the end-to-end analysis of sequence data -- from from raw base calling to analyzed variants ready for interpretation by users.</p>
