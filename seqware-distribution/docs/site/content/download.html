Downloads
====================

SeqWare Pipeline
-------------------
The latest version of the pipeline jar is always available on our continuous build server. Please choose the jar that has the -full suffix, e.g. [seqware-distribution-0.12.5-SNAPSHOT-full.jar](http://jenkins.res.oicr.on.ca/job/seqware/lastStableBuild/net.sourceforge.seqware$seqware-distribution/).


Source Code
----------------

We are currently in the process of migrating from SourceForge to GitHub, so our code is distributed between two locations:

1. [Subversion on SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=239239) : All of our SeqWare Pipeline, MetaDB, Portal and archetype code
2. [Git on GitHub](https://github.com/SeqWare/seqware) : Our query engine code and website documentation (including this site!)

Please be patient with us as we transition, and send any of your questions or comments to one of our [mailing lists](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=239239).
