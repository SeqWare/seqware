## Users

SeqWare is currently used by a variety of NGS users including the [Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center](http://unclineberger.org/) at UNC, at the [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](http://oicr.on.ca) in Toronto and by our commercial partner [Nimbus Informatics](http://nimbusinformatics.com).

The majority of SeqWare development is currently happening at [OICR](http://oicr.on.ca) and [Nimbus Informatics](http://nimbusinformatics.com).

## Contributions

These are the folks that have made SeqWare possible.  Most development activity now centers around SeqWare at Nimbus Informatics and OICR:

* **Brian O'Connor**: lead developer/architect. Started the project in the Nelson lab and moved in 2010 to UNC which is the TCGA center responsible for RNASeq data creation. Currently he is deploying SeqWare at OICR where he is the software architect for the Informatics and Biocomputing group. Brian focuses on SeqWare Query Engine, Pipeline, and MetaDB. You can contact Brian at briandoconnor at gmail dot com.
* **Jordan Mendler (inactive)**: developer/architect. Worked on the project in the Nelson Lab at UCLA. Jordan focused on SeqWare Pipeline.
* **Sara Grimm (inactive)**: developer/analyst. Worked on the project in the Lineberger Bioinformatics group at UNC. Sara focused on SeqWare Pipeline modules for RNAseq analysis.
* **Jianying Li (inactive)**: developer/analyst. Worked on the project in the Lineberger Bioinformatics group at UNC. Jianying focused on SeqWare Pipeline modules for QC reporting and statistical analysis on RNAseq data.
* **Matt Soloway**: developer/user. Works on the project in the Lineberger Bioinformatics group at UNC. Matt focuses on SeqWare MetaDB dataload and also workflows, which links -BOTH- modules for automated distribution of computations on the cluster -AND- results to SeqWare users.
* **Stuart Jefferys**: developer/user. Works on the project in the Lineberger Bioinformatics group at UNC. Stuart focuses on SeqWare Pipeline development.
* **Oleg Boussel, Dmitry Nevaikin, and others with VRP Inc (inactive)**: VRP created the SeqWare Portal version we have today. Recently wrapped up this consulting work.
* **Marc Carlson**: SeqWare Pipeline module developer.
* **Morgan Taschuk**: SeqWare Pipeline Developer at OICR.
* **Denis Yuen**: SeqWare Query Engine Developer at OICR.
* **Yong Liang**: SeqWare Web Service and Pipeline Developer at OICR.
