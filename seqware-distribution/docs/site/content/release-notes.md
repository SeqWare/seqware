## 1.1.0 (2015-03-12)

This release primarily captures the state of SeqWare before deployment in production for OICR GSI (Genome Sequencing Informatics). 

### Defect
* [SEQWARE-2017] - BasicDecider --force-run-all versus --ignore-previous-runs

### Improvement
* [SEQWARE-2016] - Ability to specify parent/input file accession(s) to seqware create workflow-run

## 1.1.0-rc.0 (2015-02-17)

This release primarily captures the state of SeqWare before deployment in the staging environment for OICR GSI (Genome Sequencing Informatics). 

### Defect
* [SEQWARE-2007] - command "seqware workflow-run ini" fails if "--out" not specified

### Story
* [SEQWARE-2012] - Oozie job name length redux

## 1.1.0-beta.1 (2015-01-16)

A minor release implementing a few fixes and updates needed for PDE integration testing. 

### Defect
* [SEQWARE-2002] - Could not link workflow run to its parents
* [SEQWARE-2005] - Workflow job names must be 50 characters or less (oozie restriction)

### Improvement
* [SEQWARE-2003] - OicrDecider handling of trailing delimiter in parent sample name and parent swid fields

## 1.1.0-beta.0 (2014-12-23)

This is a major release implementing all remaining features for the 1.1.0 beta release. Following releases in this series will be limited to hotfixes. 

New features include updates to the file provenance report to include workflow and workflow run annotations, aggregate skip information across all paths to a particular file, and report input file information. A new reporting resource displays JDBC and version information for the web service, file provisioning for workflows now records and checks file size and md5sum, it is now possible to pull back arbitrary entries and annotations on the CLI, and it is now possible for workflows to annotate processing events and files while a workflow is running. 

### Defect
* [SEQWARE-1993] - When using inmemory metadata method, bundle dry-run fails to execute

### Improvement
* [SEQWARE-1889] - Accessing files linked to lanes
* [SEQWARE-1981] - Include workflow run input files into the file provenance report?
* [SEQWARE-1985] - Get version of SeqWare webservice

### Task
* [SEQWARE-1956] - GCR keeps retrying a lock when the filesystem is down
* [SEQWARE-1959] - Create general mechanism to run annotator in workflows
* [SEQWARE-1970] - validate seqware version between CLI and WS
* [SEQWARE-1974] - Provision files module should record file size and md5 checksum
* [SEQWARE-1975] - Store file size and md5sum in the seqware database
* [SEQWARE-1980] - Fix dry-run option on CLI
* [SEQWARE-1991] - Pull back annotation for arbitrary sw_accession
* [SEQWARE-1992] - Make job id on sge cluster unique
* [SEQWARE-1994] - When a file with multiple paths has a path skipped, the file should be skipped


## 1.1.0-alpha.5 (2014-10-23)

This is a minor release re-enabling a deprecated web-resource for the pan-cancer project. Specifically, pulling back workflow runs by workflow. 

## 1.1.0-alpha.4 (2014-10-09)

This release is a minor release largely focused on technical debt and monitoring of code quality. Support for Cobertura and Jacoco has been added, findbugs has been integrated into the build process to reject high priority bugs (with all existing high priority bugs now fixed), maven plugin versions have been updated, commons-lang has been replaced with commons-lang3, and apache-collections has been replaced with apache-collections4. It is now also possible to schedule to 1.0.15 clusters with 1.1 series decider code. 

## 1.1.0-alpha.3 (2014-09-17)

This release is a minor release to workflow developers in order to demo and get feedback on a prototype for interpreted language deciders.

There are also a number of Oozie fixes that and seqware-bag fixes that await their own releases in their respective projects.

Highlights include a workaround for the retry utility to workaround a known issue with Oozie, an update to spring and restlet, the ability to run workflows via whitestar without a web service and without a DB, tools for bulk transition of workflows (cancel and retry), re-scheduling workflows, and a re-working of GCR to save full output to disk.   

A few new utilities and bugfixes have also been added to aid in workflow development.

## 1.1.0-alpha.1 (2014-08-11)

This release refactors much of the code and removes many of the features that were deprecated in 1.0.0. 
A couple of new workflow engines, 'whitestar' and 'whitestar-sge', are provided for development and debugging without oozie + sge and oozie respectively. 

Significant refactoring of the plugins backing our CLI was done, splitting out the functionality in WorkflowLauncher into a (Scheduled)WorkflowLauncher, WorkflowWatcher, WorkflowScheduler, and WorkflowLifeCycle (which mimics our old WorkflowLauncher). Unused .seqware/settings parameters and plugin parameters have been removed and ini parsing has been consolidated to schedule-time only. 

We have also introduced coding standards and a host of fixes for workflow developers.

Deprecated utilities removed includes:

* SequencerRunReporter
* SymLinkFileReporter (replaced by File Provenance Reporter)

Database tables removed include:

* all x_link tables 
* all shareX tables except for study and workflow run
* sample_search

Web resources:

* webservice DTO classes
* asychronous classes for scheduling and running workflows (Pegasus)
* web-resources that back SymLinkFileReporter (reporting files associated with studies, sequencer runs, samples, etc.)
* web resources that back SequencerRunReporter
* IUSsearch, "x" libraries resources, and excess file attributes services

We have also removed support for the old workflow engine meaning we have dropped support for Pegasus, Condor, and Globus. 

### Improvement
* [SEQWARE-1797] - Create integration tests for BasicDecider based on tutorial and hook them in
* [SEQWARE-1882] - More informative error output in seqware bundle launch
* [SEQWARE-1902] - Retrieve the effective INI for a workflow-run in the CLI

### Task

## 1.0.14 (2014-04-21)

This release contains mostly usability improvements. New features include the ability to target deciders by root samples and a sanity check tool that can run some basic checks to diagnose issues with SeqWare installs.

## 1.0.12 (2014-03-19)

Note that the fix for 1860 creates an update to the oozie-sge plugin (version 1.0.2). The fix for SEQWARE-1848 may also require some special care, previous versions of the 1.0.X workflow launcher would run steps in a workflow using system Java. 1.0.12 enforces that the bundled Java is used; this will cause problems for workflows bundled with 1.0.11 so either launch those with 1.0.11 or rebundle with Java 1.7. Older bundles should be unaffected.  

Other changes are largely self-explanatory and generally improve usability.
