##History

SeqWare was created in 2007 by Brian O'Connor while he was a postdoc in the Nelson Lab at UCLA.  Brian moved to UNC in 2010 to be a research associate in the Lineberger center where the project grew and developed into the pipeline system used for the center's TCGA RNA-Seq analyis.  In 2011 Brian moved to OICR in Toronto where he's currently a software architect and manager for the Software Engineering team. SeqWare continues to be developed by his team and is used for the institutes NGS data analysis needs, including for various ICGC projects.

##Components

SeqWare currently provides 5 main tools specifically designed to support massively parallel sequencing technologies. All tools can be used together or separately:

* **MetaDB**: provides a common database to store metadata used by all components.
* **Portal**: a LIMS-like web application to manage samples, record computational events, and present results back to end users.
* **Pipeline**: a workflow engine that is capable of wrapping and combining other tools (BFAST, BWA, SAMtools, etc) into complex pipelines, recording metadata about the analysis, and facilitates automation of pipelines based on metadata.
* **Web Service**: a programmatic API that lets people build new tools on top of the project
* **Query Engine**: a NOSQL database designed to store and query variants and other events inferred from sequence data.
