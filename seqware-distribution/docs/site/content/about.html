SeqWare
============

The open source SeqWare project is a portable software infrastructure designed to analyze massive genomics datasets produced by contemporary and emerging technologies, in particular Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platforms.  It consists of a comprehensive suite of tools focused on enabling the end-to-end analysis of sequence data -- from from raw base calling to analyzed variants ready for interpretation by users.

SeqWare currently provides four tools specifically designed to support massively parallel sequencing technologies. All four tools can be used together or separately. 

* **Portal**: a LIMS-like web application to manage samples, record computational events, and present results back to end users. 
*  **Pipeline**: a workflow engine that is capable of wrapping and combining other tools (BFAST, BWA, SAMtools, etc) into complex pipelines, recording metadata about the analysis, and facilitates automation of pipelines based on metadata. 
* **Query Engine**:  a query tool to store and query variants and other events inferred from sequence data. 
*  **MetaDB**: provides a common database to store metadata used by all components. 

SeqWare is currently used by a variety of NGS users including the [Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at UNC](http://unclineberger.org/), at the [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Toronto](http://oicr.on.ca/) and by our commercial partner [Nimbus Informatics](http://nimbusinformatics.com/).
