Transition from SourceForge
-------------

We are currently transitioning to off of SourceForge to GitHub and other services.  This is a pretty big task since we have years of content in our current wiki, multiple bug tracking systems, and two mailing lists. Please bear with us while we make this migration.  In the mean time you can find our subversion repository and current wiki on SourceForge, see:

* the SourceForge [developers site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/seqware/)
* the SourceForge [wiki page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/seqware/) for lots of detailed, developer docs

Our new site (this one) is hosted on GitHub and we plan on migrating all of our documentation here, the main project webpage, our public bug tracker and, of course, our code repository (from subversion to git).  The two new sites are:

* the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/SeqWare/seqware) for SeqWare
* the [public website](http://seqware.github.com) (this one) hosted on GitHub

Mailing Lists
-------------

For the time being our [mailing lists](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=239239) are still hosted on SourceForge.

Issue Tracker
-------------

If you encounter bugs or want to make a feature request please email the developer list above (you will need to sign up) and also submit a bug to our [issue tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=239239) currently on SourceForge.

Wiki
----

When the transition to GitHub is complete this site will contain all the documentation and we will no longer have a wiki (at least that''s the plan).  In the mean time you can still use the [public wiki](http://seqware.sf.net/) on SourceForge which is tailored to developers and is not particularly friendly to new users.  This site should be a much better introduction to our project but we are still adding content.

Repositories
------------

There are currently two repositories used by the project (see below). The SourceForge repo has all the sub-projects (and several years of cruft)  while the GitHub repository has this documentation and the latest SeqWare Query Engine. We will transition from subversion to git as soon as we can.  If you have something that youâ€™d like to be part of nanoc, send us a pull request!

* the GitHub git [repository](https://github.com/SeqWare/seqware) for SeqWare
* the SourceForge subversion [repository](http://sourceforge.net/projects/seqware/develop)
