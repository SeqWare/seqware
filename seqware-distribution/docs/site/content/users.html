User Guide
============

SeqWare is an open-source bioinformatics workflow deployment and management system. Its core features include:

* A centralized metadata database that tracks samples, annotations and analyses, and a web application to visualize it
* A module specification and execution engine that lets you package computational tools and use them to build and run complex analytical workflows
* Support for running workflows irrespective of the underlying cluster environment
* An advanced query engine that allows you to store and search variants, coverage, and annotations produced in your workflows using either a simple or distributed database backend 

This Guide
---------

The major point of this guide is to describe how, as a user, you would log into a pre-configured SeqWare server and start launching workflows. It is focused on running existing workflows and creating new workflows using the SeqWare Pipeline API.

This guide assumes your starting with SeqWare, and its various components, already installed. It assumes that you or your admin have already setup and tested SeqWare. This guide picks up where the installation guide leaves off and walks you through the process of launching SeqWare workflows for the first time.


Download the Project
---------------------

Every user using SeqWare Pipeline and other tools in the SeqWare project will need to download the code into your home directory using Subversion. Instructions are available on the SeqWare SourceForge page.

* [Workflow Run Reporter](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/seqware/index.php?title=Workflow_Run_Reporter): Find the identity and library samples and input and output files from one or more workflow runs. 

### Import Tools
* [FileLinker](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/seqware/index.php?title=FileLinker) : Import files into the MetaDB and link them with IUS's or lanes. 

### Metadata Tools
* [AttributeAnnotator](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/seqware/index.php?title=AttributeAnnotator) : Annotate items in the MetaDB with 'skip' or key-value pairs.
