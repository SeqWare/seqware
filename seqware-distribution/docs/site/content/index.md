        <h1>Next-Generation Sequencing Analysis on the Grid and in the Cloud</h1>

	<p>The open source SeqWare project is a portable software
infrastructure designed to analyze massive genomics datasets produced by
contemporary and emerging technologies, in particular Next Generation
Sequencing (NGS) platforms.  It consists of a comprehensive suite of
infrastructure tools focused on enabling the end-to-end analysis of sequence
data -- from from raw base calling to analyzed variants ready for
interpretation by users. See the "<a href="/about/">About SeqWare</a>" and the "<a
href="/docs/1-introduction/">Introduction to SeqWare</a>" documents for more details.
The "<a href="/docs/">Documentation</a>" pages show how to install and use
SeqWare. In particular, we recommend new users begin with the three getting
started guide found in the documentation section and linked to below.</p>
