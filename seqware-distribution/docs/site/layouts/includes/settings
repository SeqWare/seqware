# SEQWARE PIPELINE SETTINGS

# The settings in this file are tagged by when they are used.
# COMMON: Used by all components
# INSTALL: Used when installing a workflow bundle
# SCHEDULE: Used when a user wants to schedule a workflow run
# LAUNCH: Used when a workflow run is to be launched (or dry-run)
# DELETION: Used for the admin web service supporting deletion
#
# Remote users need COMMON and SCHEDULE.
# Workflow developers need COMMON and LAUNCH for testing.
# Administrators need COMMON, DELETION, and INSTALL.
# Cronjobs/daemon processes will need COMMON and LAUNCH.

# Keys that are required for a typical Oozie-sge installation with metadata via web service are marked as required.
