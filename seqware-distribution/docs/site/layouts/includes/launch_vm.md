Please launch your local VM in VirtualBox or cloud AMI on Amazon now.  For the local VM, login as user <kbd>seqware</kbd>,
password <kbd>seqware</kbd> at this time. Click on the "SeqWare Directory" link
on the desktop which will open a terminal to the location where we installed
the SeqWare tools. Alternatively, on the Amazon AMI follow the directions to
log in
[here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html).
Once logging into the instance you need to "switch user" to <kbd>seqware</kbd>,
e.g.:

        sudo su - seqware
