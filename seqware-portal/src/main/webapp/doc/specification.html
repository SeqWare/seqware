	<h1>Solexa <abbr title="Laboratory Information Management System">LIMS</abbr>:
		Specification
	</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>	The Solexa machine is a high-throughput machine for genomic sequencing.
		During a single run of the machine, several lanes are filled with
		samples that are to be sequenced as part of an experiment.  To optimize
		the use of the hardware, it is best to have all of the lanes used even
		if the samples in the lanes come from different experiments.
		Solexa-<abbr title="Laboratory Information Management
		System">LIMS</abbr> is designed to help people allocate experimental
		samples to different lanes in order maximize the value of each run
		without incurring additional costs.
	</p>

	<h2>System Workflow</h2>
	<p> When an <i>experimenter</i> logs in to the Solexa LIMS, he sees his
		<i>experiment</i>s, the associated <i>sample</i>s, and their status in
		the data-processing <i>pipeline</i>.  <i>Sample</i>s may be added to
		<i>experiment</i>s at any time.  When a <i>sample</i> is added, it is
		assigned a sample-identification number from the LIMS system that the
		<i>experimenter</i> should affix to it prior to handing it off to the
		<i>lab technician</i>.
	</p>
	<p>	The <i>lab technician</i> will either place the <i>sample</i> in
		temporary storage, or immediately prepare for a <i>run</i> of the Solexa
		machine.  When preparing for a <i>run</i>, the technician will assign
		<i>sample</i>s to the <i>lane</i>s within the LIMS, and then physically
		do the same in the Solexa machine.
	</p>
	<p>	Once the <i>run</i> of the machine is complete, the Solexa data begins
		flowing through the <i>step</i>s of the data processing
		</i>pipeline</i>.  The LIMS is kept apprised of the status of each
		processing <i>step</i> the <i>lane</i> goes through.  The individual
		pieces of processing software are controlled by the
		<kbd>solexa-pipeline</kbd> scripts which insert descriptive <i>step</i>
		metadata into the LIMS as the data is processed.
	</p>
	<p> NOTE: Some provisions exist in the LIMS for tagging <i>sample</i>s so
		that the sequence data may be post-processed/analyzed differently, (even
		as part of samples from separate experiments), though this feature has
		not yet been designed/implemented and may be part of a future
		enhancement to the LIMS and <kbd>solexa-pipeline</kbd>.

					Use Case illustrating its limitations: Graduate student
					submits an experiment, gets data from processing of
					experiment.  Billing (see below) should go to the external
					lab the graduate student belongs to, not the graduate
					student.  Also, when the graduate student leaves the lab,
					ownership of the experiment and data needs to revert to the
					lab, or at least be inherited by the lab.</p>
