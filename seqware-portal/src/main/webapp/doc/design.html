	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<img src="classes-attributes-and-associations.png" style="float: right" />
	<p>	Because the tagging of samples is not yet implemented, the assignment of
		samples to lanes is on a one sample to one lane basis, so they are
		modelled internally as a single object called a <i>lane</i>.
	</p>
	<p>	The user interface for the experimenter is very similar to that for the
		lab technician, except they will not see the following fields (on
		<kbd>Experiment.jsp</kbd>):
		<ul><li>(lane) name (in favor of showing <kbd>sample_name</kbd>)</li>
			<li>cycles to use</li>
			<li>reference lanes</li>
			<li>skip processing</li>
		</ul>
		Also, experimenters may add more than 8 samples to the experiment.
		Both will be able to see the <kbd>sample_name</kbd> and
		<kbd>sample_code</kbd>, but only the experimenter may edit it.
	</p>

	<p>	The software is implemented with the open source packages:
		<ul><li>Tomcat (Apache)</li>
			<li>Spring</li>
			<li>JSTL</li>
			<li>Hibernate</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>	Work remaining to be done (ordered by approximate priority):
		<ol><li>Modify authentication system to know about the different user
				roles. (1-4 hr)
			</li>
			<li>When showing list to an experimenter, limit list of experiments
				and samples/lanes to those "owned" by the experimenter. (2 hr)
			</li>
			<li>When an experimenter edits a sample/lane, hide the fields listed
				above. (3/4 hr)
			</li>
			<li>Build user interface that assigns samples to lanes. (20 hr)</li>
			<li>Increase timeout to about 1 hour (1/2 hr)</li>
			<li>Auto-login to account after the account is created iff the user
				creating the account is not an administrator. (3/4 hr)
			</li>
			<li>"Port" the data in the database to correctly model the
				concepts of <i>process</i> and <i>lane</i>. (Brian)
			</li>
			<li><i>See list of Future Features on specification.</i></li>
		</ol>
