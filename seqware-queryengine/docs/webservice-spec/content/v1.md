# Generic Feature Store API v1

This describes the resources that make up the Generic Feature Store API v1. If
you have any problems or requests please contact
[Stuart Watt](mailto:stuart.watt@oicr.on.ca).

**Note:** This API is under active development. Breaking changes can and will occur.

## Client Errors

There are three possible types of client errors on API calls that
receive request bodies:

1. Sending invalid JSON will result in a `400 Bad Request` response.

        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Length: 35

        {"message":"Problems parsing JSON"}

2. Sending the wrong type of JSON values will result in a `400 Bad
   Request` response.

        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Length: 40

        {"message":"Body should be a JSON Hash"}

3. Sending invalid files will result in a 422 Unprocessable Entity
   response.

        HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
        Content-Length: 149

        {
          "message": "Validation Failed",
          "errors": [
            {
              "resource": "Issue",
              "field": "title",
              "code": "missing_field"
            }
          ]
        }

All error objects have resource and field properties so that your client
can tell what the problem is.  There's also an error code to let you
know what is wrong with the field.  These are the possible validation error 
codes:

missing
: This means a resource does not exist.

missing\_field
: This means a required field on a resource has not been set.

invalid
: This means the formatting of a field is invalid.  The documentation
for that resource should be able to give you more specific information.

already\_exists
: This means another resource has the same value as this field.  This
can happen in resources that must have some unique key (such as Label
names).

If resources have custom validation errors, they will be documented with
the resource.

## HTTP Verbs

Where possible, Generic Feature Store API v1 strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each
action.

HEAD
: Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.

GET
: Used for retrieving resources.

POST
: Used for creating resources, or performing custom actions (such as
merging a pull request).

PUT
: Used for replacing resources or collections. For PUT requests
with no `body` attribute, be sure to set the `Content-Length` header to zero. 

DELETE
: Used for deleting resources.

## Authentication

There is one way to authenticate through Generic Feature Store API v1:

Basic Authentication:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -u "username:PASSWORD" https://api.github.com
</pre>
