        These classes define the interfaces and implementations behind the SeqWare Query Engine. 
        If the test javadoc documents have been compiled, you can also jump 
        <a href="../testapidocs/index.html"  target="_blank">here</a> in order to see demonstrations 
        of how external developers should largely interact with our software.         
     <p>
        A back-end developer may wish to start with the <b>impl</b> directories. 
        This directory contains the implementations of the various interfaces. 
        In particular, looking at {@link com.github.seqware.queryengine.impl.HBaseStorage} will demonstrate how
        tables are created and how Get/Pull operations are handled.
     <p>
        A front-end developer may wish to concentrate on the classes that are
        accessed via <b>factory</b> and the {@link com.github.seqware.queryengine.factory.SWQEFactory}. This gives access to 
        the classes that allow CRU operations in a generic fashion. They should
        also look at the classes in <b>model</b> which are how users interact 
        with the SeqWare Query Engine back-end. 
     <p> 
        Finally, a plugin-developer should additionally look at the interfaces in
        <b>plugins</b>. New plugins should conform to these interfaces.
