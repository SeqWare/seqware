 * in, say, LociWalkers from GATK without modification. I'm not sure how
 * practical this this, thought. We can, at least, use their same basic
 * interface, see
 * http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsa/wiki/index.php/Your_first_walker:
 *
 * Here's an extremely basic interface, we will really need to work on this and
 * figure out what the object inputs are for these methods and what they should
 * return (just using ReturnValue as placeholder).
