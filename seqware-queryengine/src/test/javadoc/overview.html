        This set of tests and test suites should be used for a quick understanding of 
        how to interact with the SeqWare Query Engine. If the main javadoc documents have been 
        compiled, you can also jump 
        <a href="../apidocs/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> in order to see details on our 
        back-end implementation.
        <p>
            The tests are all run from test suites in each of the testing directories. 
            Multiple test suites in the model directory allow the tests to run against multiple serialization types, different back-ends, and optimizations in the model layer. Suites are built with (and new tests have to be added) to the DynamicSuiteBuilder in each of the testing directories.
